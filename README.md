### hey there 👋 سلام

<!--
**sxnaan/sxnaan** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->
my name is sinaan younus `[sin-ahh-n you-niss]` (he/him) and i'm currently a sophomore at the university of maryland, college park!

- 🔭 i’m studying computer science and applied math, and love working on projects with social impact
- 🕵 i'm fascinated by emerging technologies like ai/ml and blockchain, and i'm building my experience through coursework and research
- 🌱 along with programming, i'm a freelance web designer! i plan on having a full portfolio up soon, but some of the sites i've made include https://stanfordacts.com, https://theeduproject.net, https://tahiracademy.org (currently being revamped as of 1.7.2021), https://islaminbaltimore.org, and https://educationahmadiyya.us
- 📚 i'm also very interested in other domains like political economy, philosophy, logic, and linguisitics
- 🍽 like a lot of us, covid turned me into a home-cook -- my latest creation was ratatouille (yes like from the movie) with stuffed salmon, and i'm hoping to star in a season of master chef (junior) once its back on air

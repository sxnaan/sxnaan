my name is sinaan younus [sin-ahh-n you-niss] (he/him) and i'm currently a sophomore at the university of maryland, college park!

- 🔭 i’m currently studying computer science and applied math, and love working on projects in the intersection of the two (statistics, economics, etc.)
- 🕵 i'm fascinated by emerging technologies like ai/ml and blockchain, and i'm building my experience through coursework and my own independent research
- 🌱 along with programming, i'm a freelance web designer! i plan on having a full portfolio up soon, but some of the recent sites i've made are:
  - https://stanfordacts.com
  - https://theeduproject.net
  - https://tahiracademy.org (currently being revamped as of 1.7.2021)
- 🍽 i love cooking -- my latest creation was ratatouille (yes like from the movie) with stuffed salmon
